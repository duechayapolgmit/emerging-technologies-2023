1. Anaconda (or Python)
2. Git
3. Visual Studio Code
4. Qiskit (via `pip install` command)
5. Numpy (via `pip install` command)

To view the project, these are the steps required:
1. Install all the prerequisite programs mentioned above.
2. Clone the repository into a directory you want the program to be in.
3. Open the repository via Visual Studio Code.
4. Select the notebook that you want to view.
5. Then, click "Run All", to initially run the code blocks at first. (to set up the variables and imports) You can then click on each code block to see each block in execution.
